# Character Statistics

## Pre-requisite

- Install **Node.js 16+** (or 14 using `node --experimental-wasm-threads`) and **npm 6+** preferrably using a [Node version manager](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/install)

## Usage

1. Install dependencies

```console
npm install
```

2. Compile code

```console
npx tsc
```

3. Run unit tests
```console
node dist/char_stat.js
```

If you have edited the source code, make sure you re-run step 2.
